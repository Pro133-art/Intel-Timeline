        </h2>
        <p class="subtitle body">
          Intel's sustainability path has shifted from early performance-per-watt
          wins to a cradle-to-grave strategy that embeds energy efficiency in
          advanced manufacturing. The move from high-heat architectures to hybrid
          designs and the Intel 18A (1.8nm) node decouples performance from impact
          through PowerVia energy delivery and RibbonFET leakage reduction. RISE
          2030 targets a 10x product efficiency gain and net-zero operations by
          2040, backed by 99%+ renewable electricity worldwide. A circular economy
          push now includes 97% recyclable packaging and strong hardware recovery,
          so each processor generation, from Sierra Forest to future glass
          substrate platforms, trims the digital carbon footprint.
