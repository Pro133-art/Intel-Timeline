          <h3>Focus on Performance per Watt</h3>
          <p>
            Intel prioritizes performance per watt over raw clock speed,
            reducing electricity use, heat output, and cooling demand in PCs
            and data centers.

        <!-- Public efficiency targets become core requirements -->
        <article class="timeline-card">
          <div class="timeline-year">2012</div>
          <h3>Formal Energy Efficiency Targets</h3>
          <p>
            Public commitments make large-scale efficiency gains a core
            requirement for client and data-center processor designs.

        <!-- Process node shrinks lower power consumption -->
        <article class="timeline-card">
          <div class="timeline-year">2014-2019</div>
          <h3>Process Node Shrinks (22nm to 14nm)</h3>
          <p>
            Smaller transistors reduce leakage and improve energy efficiency per
            computation, lowering electricity demand for billions of devices.

        <!-- Hybrid cores reduce power for lighter workloads -->
        <article class="timeline-card">
          <div class="timeline-year">2021-Present</div>
          <h3>Hybrid Architecture and Efficiency Cores</h3>
          <p>
            Hybrid CPU designs use high-efficiency cores for low-power tasks,
            reducing overall system power without sacrificing performance.

        <!-- Efficiency gains tied to net-zero commitments -->
        <article class="timeline-card">
          <div class="timeline-year">2022</div>
          <h3>Alignment with Net-Zero Commitments</h3>
          <p>
            Processor efficiency gains are formally tied to Intel's net-zero
            greenhouse gas goals, recognizing product energy use as a major
            lifecycle emissions driver.
